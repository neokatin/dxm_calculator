# DXM Harm Reduction Calculator

**⚠️ This tool is for educational and harm reduction purposes only. It does not promote or encourage the use of DXM or any substance. ⚠️**

This is a mobile-friendly DXM dosage calculator designed to help reduce harm for individuals who may already be using DXM-containing products (including Triple Cs). It calculates an estimated dosage in **mg/kg** based on your body weight and the form of DXM used.

## 🧮 How It Works

Enter:
- Your weight in kilograms
- The product type (e.g., RoboCough, Triple Cs, Robitussin DX)
- The amount taken (e.g., number of tablets or mL)

It will then:
- Show the total DXM in mg
- Show how much that is per kg of body weight
- Highlight which plateau range you're in

## 🚨 Important Warnings

- **Triple Cs (Coricidin Cough & Cold)** contain **chlorpheniramine maleate (CPM)** which is **toxic at recreational doses**. This calculator **warns** you but still includes it for the sake of harm reduction.
- DXM in high doses can cause **serotonin syndrome**, **respiratory issues**, and long-term cognitive effects.
- Mixing DXM with other substances (especially SSRIs, MAOIs, alcohol, or stimulants) can be fatal.
